HOW TO OPERATE – OUT OF THE BOX GUIDE
###Prerequisites

**NOTE** you should run this out of the terminal (command prompt or windows powershell)  as some IDE may cause issues.

To build and run this application, you need the following installed:

1. Java JDK 11

Verify installation:

java -version
javac -version


Both should report version 11.x.

2. Apache Ant (Build Tool) Apache Ant version 1.9.15 

Verify installation:

ant -version

3. Bundled Apache Tomcat 7

This project includes a working Tomcat server located in:

apache-tomcat-7.0.109/


Do not rename or move this folder, unless you also update tomcat.home inside build.xml.

####Required JAR Libraries

The following JAR files are required and should be present where build.xml expects them:

lib/ directory:

H2 Database Driver (e.g., h2-x.x.x.jar)

junit-4.13.2.jar

hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

Any other application libraries

JARs referenced (based on my build.xml):
1. junit-4.13.2.jar

Used for unit testing (JUnit 4). https://search.maven.org/artifact/junit/junit/4.13.2/jar 

2. hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

Required dependency for JUnit assertions. https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.hamcrest/hamcrest-core/1.3/jar

3. h2-1.4.200.jar

H2 embedded database driver used for the application’s database. https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.h2database/h2/1.4.200/jar

4. mysql-connector-java-5.1.49-bin.jar

MySQL JDBC driver (if your project supports MySQL). https://search.maven.org/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.49/jar

5. javax.servlet-api-3.0.1.jar

Servlet API for compiling servlet classes. https://search.maven.org/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api/3.0.1/jar


You must:

Keep them in lib/

| tomcat/                           (Tomcat folder)

####Building & Running the Project with Ant

Navigate into the project folder:
Example: (where your foldeer is located): cd "path\to\Fall2025Project"

####Full Pipeline (recommended)

Compiles → WAR → Deploy → Start local Tomcat → Open browser.

ant


This automatically opens:

http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project

####Ant Build Targets (What They Do)

clean: Deletes build/ and dist/ directories.

ant clean

test: Runs all JUnit tests. Results saved under build/test-reports/.

ant test

deploy: build + compile + war + server + deploy

ant

Tomcat will deploy it automatically on startup.


####How to Run the Application (Summary)

Install JDK 11 and Ant.

Ensure all required JAR files are in the correct locations.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

Example: cd "path\to\Fall2025Project"

Build and run:

ant

Your browser will open automatically to:

http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project

To stop Tomcat:

ctrl c

or

ant stop-tomcat   

####Database Configuration

The DBConnection class configures database connectivity.

H2 example settings:

jdbc:h2:~/pizzas505db

user: sa

password: (empty)

jdbc:h2:file:./data/restaurantdb user: root

password: no password

####Accessing the H2 Database Console

H2 console is at:

http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project/h2

Useful SQL queries:

SELECT * FROM USERS;

SELECT * FROM STAFF;

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;

SELECT * FROM TABLES;

SELECT * FROM MENUITEM;

SELECT * FROM ORDERS;

SELECT * FROM ORDERITEMS;

####Email Configuration (JavaMail)

EmailUtil.java is used for outgoing email functionality such as order confirmations and reservation notifications. Example Gmail SMTP settings:

TLS enabled

Authentication required

Note: Gmail requires an App Password (not your normal Gmail password).

####Running Tests

JUnit tests are executed using:

ant test

####Summary of Commands

ant → build + compile + war + server + deploy

ant clean → remove build directories

ant test → run JUnit tests
