HOW TO OPERATE – OUT OF THE BOX GUIDE
###Prerequisites

**NOTE** you should run this out of the terminal (command prompt or windows powershell)  as some IDE may cause issues.

To build and run this application, you need the following installed:

1. Java JDK 11

Verify installation:

java -version
javac -version


Both should report version 11.x.

2. Apache Ant (Build Tool)

Verify installation:

ant -version

3. Bundled Apache Tomcat 7

This project includes a working Tomcat server located in:

apache-tomcat-7.0.109/


Do not rename or move this folder, unless you also update tomcat.home inside build.xml.

####Required JAR Libraries

The following JAR files are required and should be present where build.xml expects them:

lib/ directory:

H2 Database Driver (e.g., h2-x.x.x.jar)

junit-4.13.2.jar

hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

Any other application libraries

JARs referenced one folder above (based on build.xml):
1. junit-4.13.2.jar

Used for unit testing (JUnit 4). https://search.maven.org/artifact/junit/junit/4.13.2/jar 

2. hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

Required dependency for JUnit assertions. https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.hamcrest/hamcrest-core/1.3/jar

3. h2-1.4.200.jar

H2 embedded database driver used for the application’s database. https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.h2database/h2/1.4.200/jar

4. mysql-connector-java-5.1.49-bin.jar

MySQL JDBC driver (if your project supports MySQL). https://search.maven.org/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.49/jar

5. javax.servlet-api-3.0.1.jar

You must:

Keep them in lib/

└ tomcat/                           (Legacy Tomcat folder)

####Building & Running the Project with Ant

Navigate into the project folder:
Example: (where your foldeer is located): cd "path\to\Fall2025Project"

####Full Pipeline (recommended)

Compiles → WAR → Deploy → Start local Tomcat → Open browser.

ant


This automatically opens:

http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project

####Ant Build Targets (What They Do)
clean
ant clean


Deletes build/ and dist/ directories.

compile
ant compile


Compiles Java classes from src/ into build/classes.

compile-tests
ant compile-tests


Compiles test classes into build/test-classes.

test
ant test


Runs all JUnit tests. Results saved under build/test-reports/.

war
ant war


Builds the dist/Fall2025Project.war file.

package
ant package


Runs: clean + war.

deploy
ant deploy


Copies the WAR into:

apache-tomcat-7.0.109/webapps/


Tomcat will deploy it automatically on startup.

start-tomcat
ant start-tomcat


Starts Tomcat using the embedded server.
Automatically assigns CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE.

stop-tomcat
ant stop-tomcat


Stops the Tomcat server cleanly.

run (default target)
ant run


Runs the entire workflow:

clean

compile

war

deploy

start-tomcat

open browser

all
ant all


Runs: clean → compile → test → war.

####How to Run the Application (Summary)

Install JDK 11 and Ant.

Ensure all required JAR files are in the correct locations.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

cd "path\to\Fall2025Project"


Build and run:

ant


Your browser will open automatically to:

http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project


To stop Tomcat:

ctrl c
or
ant stop-tomcat   

####Database Configuration
The DBConnection class configures database connectivity.
H2 example settings:
jdbc:h2:~/pizzas505db
user: sa
password: (empty)
jdbc:h2:file:./data/restaurantdb user: root
password: no password

####Accessing the H2 Database Console
If H2 console is enabled (-Dh2.console=true), access it at:
http://localhost:8080/Fall2025Project/h2
Useful SQL queries:
SELECT * FROM USERS;
SELECT * FROM STAFF;
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
SELECT * FROM TABLES;
SELECT * FROM MENUITEM;
SELECT * FROM ORDERS;
SELECT * FROM ORDERITEMS;

####Email Configuration (JavaMail)
EmailUtil.java is used for outgoing email functionality such as order confirmations and reservation notifications. Example Gmail SMTP settings:
TLS enabled
Authentication required
Note: Gmail requires an App Password (not your normal Gmail password).

####Running Tests
JUnit tests are executed using:
ant test
Reports output to: build/test-reports/

####Summary of Commands
ant → build + compile + war + server + deploy
ant all → clean + compile + test + war
ant clean → remove build directories
ant compile → compile Java source

ant test → run JUnit tests
